# World_Weather_Analysis

### Purpose

An app for the travel company, PlanMyTrip, was created to find the nearest city to randomly generated GPS coordintates. Not only did we map these locations, but we made lodging suggestions for the nearest hotel, as well as added current weather descriptions to each city. From there we set up the app to take inputs from the customer on their prefered temperature range, to give vacation suggestions. Finally, four cities were chosen to visit on a road trip and a map of the driving route was generated.
